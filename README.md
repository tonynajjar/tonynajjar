### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tony Najjar

I'm currently working at [Angsa Robotics](https://angsa-robotics.com/en-de/) as Senior Robotics Software Engineer. I work across a wide range of the autonomy stack, mainly navigation, behavior, control, hardware drivers but also partially on localization and perception.

### ðŸ’» Open Source Work

I work mainly with ROS2 and try to contribute back as much as I can. You can find my PR contributions [here](https://github.com/search?q=is:pr+author:tonynajjar&type=pullrequests), my issues contributions [here](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Atonynajjar&type=issues).
