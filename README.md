### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tony Najjar

I'm currently working at [Angsa Robotics](https://angsa-robotics.com/en-de/) as Senior Robotics Software Engineer. I work across a wide range of the autonomy stack, mainly navigation, behavior, control, hardware drivers but also partially on localization and perception.

### ðŸ’» Open Source Work

I work mainly with ROS2 and try to contribute back as much as I can. You can find my PR contributions [here](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atonynajjar+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+is%3Apublic), my issues contributions [here](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+author%3Atonynajjar+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic). Most notably I contributed the [Tricycle controller](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/pull/345) to ros2_controllers.

### ðŸŒ¹ ChatGPT Poem

Tony the robotics software engineer, <br> 
His passion for robots ever so clear, <br> 
A wizard with code, a master of craft, <br> 
His machines, a creation that'll forever last. <br> 

Control systems are his machines' backbone, <br> 
With behavior and reasoning, they've grown, <br> 
Tony's robots navigate with agility and grace, <br> 
Their mission, to conquer every space. <br> 

Python and C++, his weapons of choice, <br> 
Tony's robots, they rejoice, <br> 
Efficient and fast, their code so clean, <br> 
A wonder to behold, a programmer's dream. <br> 

Tony the robotics software engineer, <br> 
A visionary whose dream is so sincere, <br> 
To create machines that learn, evolve, and grow, <br> 
His passion for robots, a never-ending glow. <br>
