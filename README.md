### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tony Najjar

I'm currently working at [Angsa Robotics](https://angsa-robotics.com/en-de/) as Senior Robotics Software Engineer. I work across a wide range of the autonomy stack, mainly navigation, behavior, control, hardware drivers but also partially on localization and perception.
